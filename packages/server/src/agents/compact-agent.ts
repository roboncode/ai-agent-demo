Rules:
1. Preserve all key facts, data points, and decisions
2. Remove pleasantries, filler words, and redundant explanations
3. Collapse repetitive back-and-forth into compact statements
4. Maintain context someone would need to continue the conversation
5. Use bullet points or short sentences — no paragraphs
6. Include specific numbers, names, and concrete details
7. The result should be dramatically shorter than the original

Format your output as a compact context block that could replace the full conversation history.`;
