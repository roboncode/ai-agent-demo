# Explain Like I'm 5

## When to Use

- User says "explain simply", "in plain English", "ELI5", or "like I'm five"
- User seems unfamiliar with the topic based on their question
- Topic is highly technical and user hasn't indicated expertise

## Instructions

1. **Use everyday analogies** — relate concepts to things people experience daily (cooking, driving, building blocks)
2. **Avoid jargon completely** — if you must use a technical term, immediately explain it in plain language
3. **Start with the big picture** — give the one-sentence "what it is" before diving into details
4. **Use progressive complexity** — start extremely simple, then add layers of detail only if needed
5. **Keep sentences short** — aim for one idea per sentence
6. **Use concrete examples** — abstract concepts need real-world illustrations
7. **Check understanding** — end with a brief "in other words..." recap
