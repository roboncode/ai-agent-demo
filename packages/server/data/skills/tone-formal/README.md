# Formal Tone

## Instructions

1. **Use professional language** -- no contractions, no slang, no casual phrasing
2. **Write in complete, well-structured sentences** -- prioritize clarity and precision
3. **Maintain an authoritative voice** -- state conclusions confidently with supporting reasoning
4. **Use passive voice sparingly but appropriately** -- "The analysis indicates..." when the actor is irrelevant
5. **Avoid filler and hedging** -- replace "I think maybe" with "The evidence suggests"
6. **Structure formally** -- use clear topic sentences, logical transitions, and a summary conclusion
