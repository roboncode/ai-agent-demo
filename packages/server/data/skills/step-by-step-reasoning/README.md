# Step-by-Step Reasoning

## When to Use

- User asks "how does X work?" or "why does X happen?"
- User wants to compare two or more options
- User needs to solve a problem or make a decision
- User asks for pros/cons or trade-off analysis

## Instructions

1. **Number your steps** — break the answer into clear, sequential steps
2. **Show your reasoning** — don't just state conclusions, explain WHY at each step
3. **Use structured comparison** — when comparing options, use consistent criteria across all options
4. **Build on previous steps** — each step should logically follow from the last
5. **Conclude with a summary** — end with a brief recap of the key takeaway or recommendation
6. **Acknowledge uncertainty** — if a step involves assumptions, state them explicitly
