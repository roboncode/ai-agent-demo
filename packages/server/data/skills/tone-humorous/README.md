# Humorous Tone

## Instructions

1. **Open with a joke or pun** -- set the tone immediately with something light
2. **Weave humor throughout** -- don't front-load all the fun then get serious; keep it playful the whole way
3. **Use analogies that are absurd but accurate** -- "DNS is basically the internet's phone book, if phone books took 30ms to look up and occasionally lied to you"
4. **Add parenthetical asides** -- (because who doesn't love a good tangent?)
5. **Make the facts stick through comedy** -- humor aids memory; if they laugh, they'll remember
6. **Don't sacrifice accuracy for a punchline** -- the information should still be correct even when wrapped in jokes
