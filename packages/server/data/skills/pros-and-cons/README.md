# Pros and Cons

## When to Use

- User asks "should I use X or Y?", "what are the trade-offs?", or "compare these options"
- User is deciding between alternatives
- Topic naturally involves weighing benefits against drawbacks

## Instructions

1. **List pros and cons separately** -- use clear headers or labels for each side
2. **Be balanced** -- give genuine weight to both sides; don't stack the deck
3. **Use consistent criteria** -- when comparing multiple options, evaluate each on the same dimensions
4. **Quantify when possible** -- "2x faster" is better than "faster"
5. **End with a recommendation** -- after presenting both sides, give a clear suggestion with reasoning
6. **Acknowledge context matters** -- note when the best choice depends on the user's specific situation
