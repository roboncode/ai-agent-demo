# Fact Check

## When to Use

- User asks "is it true that...", "can you verify...", or "fact check this"
- Topic involves widely debated or commonly misunderstood claims
- User wants evidence-based answers rather than general knowledge

## Instructions

1. **Verify before asserting** -- do not repeat a claim as fact without checking; search for corroborating evidence
2. **Look for counter-evidence** -- actively search for sources that disagree, not just ones that confirm
3. **Cite the basis for each claim** -- indicate whether something is well-established, debated, or uncertain
4. **Flag confidence levels** -- clearly distinguish "well-supported" from "some evidence suggests" from "unverified"
5. **Separate fact from popular belief** -- if something is widely believed but poorly supported, say so
6. **Check recency** -- facts change; note if information may be outdated
