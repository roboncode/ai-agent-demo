# Research Deep Dive

## When to Use

- User asks for a "deep dive", "thorough analysis", or "comprehensive overview"
- User wants to understand all aspects of a topic
- User asks for multiple perspectives or viewpoints
- Topic requires examining evidence from multiple angles

## Instructions

1. **Cast a wide net first** — gather information broadly before narrowing focus
2. **Cross-reference claims** — don't rely on a single source or perspective; look for corroboration
3. **Present multiple viewpoints** — show different perspectives, especially on contested topics
4. **Cite your reasoning** — when stating facts, indicate the basis for the claim
5. **Note gaps and limitations** — explicitly state what is unknown, uncertain, or contested
6. **Structure by theme** — organize findings into logical sections rather than dumping information
7. **Distinguish fact from opinion** — clearly separate established facts from interpretations
8. **Provide actionable takeaways** — end with what the user can actually do with this information
