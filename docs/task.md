TASK

Doing a demo for some developers on how to build and create agents. I want to demonstrate a few things. 
So i want to build an AI agent service that demonstrates the following:
Using tools - getWeather, Hackernews, Knowledge Base - use an public api that we can use to look up information on something (maybe movies??)
generate using prompt (non streaming)
generate using prompt (streaming)
Agents -> uses tools (Weather Agent, Hackernews Agent, Knowledge Base Agent)
Uses Supervisor agent (subagents - determines what agent to use)
Uses Human-in-the loop example
Just a normal call to generate based on prompt
Using Memory - For now maybe have it write to a file so we can visually see what is happening. We have an agent
Using some kind of security, like requiring a key - maybe comes back requiring it
Task agent that can create tasks and have other agents to it in paralell
Coding agent based on custom code
For now let's not use a database, we will just get things working using services.

If you have any further thoughts about this or questions, let me know.
